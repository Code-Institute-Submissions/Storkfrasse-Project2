## Design Choices

- ### Typography

      The fonts chosen were 'Lilita One' for the headings and 'Hachi Maru pop' for the body text.  
  - 'Lilita One' was chosen for the headings because i thought i was more fitting as a heading font
  - 'Hachi Maru pop' is used for the rules text and score text (body).

- ### Color Scheme

      I used Antique white and whit mainly so the users eye won't work to hard. the Celestial Blue is for future features.
